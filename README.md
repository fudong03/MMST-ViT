# MMST-ViT: Climate Change-aware Crop Yield Prediction via Multi-Modal Spatial-Temporal Vision Transformer

## Model Overview

![mmst-vit-arch](./input/mmst-vit-arch.png)



This repository provides the official implementation of our proposed Multi-Modal Spatial-Temporal Vision Transformer (MMST-ViT), developed for predicting crop yields at the county level across the United States. It consists of a Multi-Modal Transformer, a Spatial Transformer, and a Temporal Transformer. The Multi-Modal Transformer leverages satellite images and meteorological data during the growing season to capture the direct impact of short-term weather variations on crop growth. The Spatial Transformer learns the high-resolution spatial dependency among counties for precise crop tracking. The Temporal Transformer captures the effects of long-term climate change on crops.

## Dataset

This paper utilizes the ***Tiny CropNet*** dataset for accurate county-level crop yield predictions. Specifically, the Tiny CropNet dataset is composed of three modalities, i.e., Sentinel-2 Imagery, WRF-HRRR Computed Dataset, and USDA Crop Dataset,
with their details outlined below:

- **Sentinel-2 Imagery**: The dataset is a set of 384x384 RGB images captured by the Sentinel-2 Earth observation satellite. It provides agriculture imagery for the contiguous U.S. continent from 2017 to 2022 with a 2-week interval. Since precise agricultural tracking requires high-resolution remote sensing data, the image of a county is partitioned into multiple fine-grained grids (9Ã—9 km).

- **WRF-HRRR Computed Dataset**: The dataset, obtained from the Weather Research & Forecasting-based High-Resolution Rapid Refresh Model (WRF-HRRR), provides high-resolution meteorological data for the contiguous U.S. continent. It covers 9 weather parameters from 2017 to 2022.

- **USDA Crop Dataset**: The dataset, sourced from the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA), provides annual crop data for major crops grown in the United States (U.S.), including corn, cotton, soybean, winter wheat, etc., on a county-level basis. It covers crop information such as production and yield from 2017 to 2022.

Now, our Tiny CropNet dataset is available at [HuggingFace Datasets](https://huggingface.co/datasets/fudong03/Tiny-CropNet/tree/main).
